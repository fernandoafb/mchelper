# mchelper - Model Checking Helper

This tool parses the logs and output of the probablistic model checking tool [PRISM](http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/) experiments into handy CSV files.

Historical note: this small (and ugly) project helped me a lot back in 2011 to get data from my experiments for academic articles of my Master's thesis. There is a lot of improvements (Maven, Java 8, JCommander, etc.) which can be made, I was a much more Java noob back then, but I don't intend on improving this in the near future.

It used to be hosted in Google Code: code.google.com/p/mchelper, and it was initially automatically imported to github.
